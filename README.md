|**2025-02-27**|**DIN-CTS: Low-Complexity Depthwise-Inception Neural Network with Contrastive Training Strategy for Deepfake Speech Detection**|Lam Pham et.al.|[2502.20225](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20225)|null|**In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for deepfake speech detection (DSD) based on a lowcomplexity Depthwise-Inception Network (DIN) trained with a contrastive training strategy (CTS). In this framework, input audio recordings are first transformed into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Linear Filter (LF), which are then used to train the DIN. Once trained, the DIN processes bonafide utterances to extract audio embeddings, which are used to construct a Gaussian distribution representing genuine speech. Deepfake detection is then performed by computing the distance between a test utterance and this distribution to determine whether the utterance is fake or bonafide. To evaluate our proposed systems, we conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset of ASVspoof 2019 LA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the Depthwise-Inception Network with the contrastive learning strategy in distinguishing between fake and bonafide utterances. We achieved Equal Error Rate (EER), Accuracy (Acc.), F1, AUC scores of 4.6%, 95.4%, 97.3%, and 98.9% respectively using a single, low-complexity DIN with just 1.77 M parameters and 985 M FLOPS on short audio segments (4 seconds). Furthermore, our proposed system outperforms the single-system submissions in the ASVspoof 2019 LA challenge, showcasing its potential for real-time applications.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**Recent Advances on Generalizable Diffusion-generated Image Detection**|Qijie Xu et.al.|[2502.19716](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19716)|null|**The rise of diffusion models has significantly improved the fidelity and diversity of generated images. With numerous benefits, these advancements also introduce new risks. Diffusion models can be exploited to create high-quality Deepfake images, which poses challenges for image authenticity verification. In recent years, research on generalizable diffusion-generated image detection has grown rapidly. However, a comprehensive review of this topic is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of recent advances and classify them into two main categories: (1) data-driven detection and (2) feature-driven detection. Existing detection methods are further classified into six fine-grained categories based on their underlying principles. Finally, we identify several open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important topic.

|**2025-02-25**|**To Deepfake or Not to Deepfake: Higher Education Stakeholders' Perceptions and Intentions towards Synthetic Media**|Jasper Roe et.al.|[2502.18066](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18066)|null|**Advances in deepfake technologies, which use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to mimic a person's likeness or voice, have led to growing interest in their use in educational contexts. However, little is known about how key stakeholders perceive and intend to use these tools. This study investigated higher education stakeholder perceptions and intentions regarding deepfakes through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2).   Using a mixed-methods approach combining survey data (n=174) with qualitative interviews, we found that academic stakeholders demonstrated a relatively low intention to adopt these technologies (M=41.55, SD=34.14) and held complex views about their implementation. Quantitative analysis revealed adoption intentions were primarily driven by hedonic motivation, with a gender-specific interaction in price-value evaluations. Qualitative findings highlighted potential benefits of enhanced student engagement, improved accessibility, and reduced workload in content creation, but concerns regarding the exploitation of academic labour, institutional cost-cutting leading to automation, degradation of relationships in education, and broader societal impacts.   Based on these findings, we propose a framework for implementing deepfake technologies in higher education that addresses institutional policies, professional development, and equitable resource allocation to thoughtfully integrate AI while maintaining academic integrity and professional autonomy.**|
|**2025-02-22**|**DiffFake: Exposing Deepfakes using Differential Anomaly Detection**|Sotirios Stamnas et.al.|[2502.16247](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16247)|null|**Traditional deepfake detectors have dealt with the detection problem as a binary classification task. This approach can achieve satisfactory results in cases where samples of a given deepfake generation technique have been seen during training, but can easily fail with deepfakes generated by other techniques. In this paper, we propose DiffFake, a novel deepfake detector that approaches the detection problem as an anomaly detection task. Specifically, DiffFake learns natural changes that occur between two facial images of the same person by leveraging a differential anomaly detection framework. This is done by combining pairs of deep face embeddings and using them to train an anomaly detection model. We further propose to train a feature extractor on pseudo-deepfakes with global and local artifacts, to extract meaningful and generalizable features that can then be used to train the anomaly detection model. We perform extensive experiments on five different deepfake datasets and show that our method can match and sometimes even exceed the performance of state-of-the-art competitors.**|
|**2025-02-21**|**Methods and Trends in Detecting Generated Images: A Comprehensive Review**|Arpan Mahara et.al.|[2502.15176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15176)|null|**The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have primarily focused on deepfake detection and often lack coverage of recent advancements in synthetic image detection, particularly methods leveraging multimodal frameworks for improved forensic analysis. To address this gap, the present survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. This review systematically examines core detection methodologies, identifies commonalities among approaches, and categorizes them into meaningful taxonomies. Furthermore, given the crucial role of large-scale datasets in this field, we present an overview of publicly available datasets that facilitate further research and benchmarking in synthetic data detection.**|
|**2025-02-20**|**LAVID: An Agentic LVLM Framework for Diffusion-Generated Video Detection**|Qingyuan Liu et.al.|[2502.14994](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14994)|null|**The impressive achievements of generative models in creating high-quality videos have raised concerns about digital integrity and privacy vulnerabilities. Recent works of AI-generated content detection have been widely studied in the image field (e.g., deepfake), yet the video field has been unexplored. Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) has become an emerging tool for AI-generated content detection for its strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities. It breaks the limitations of traditional deep learning based methods faced with like lack of transparency and inability to recognize new artifacts. Motivated by this, we propose LAVID, a novel LVLMs-based ai-generated video detection with explicit knowledge enhancement. Our insight list as follows: (1) The leading LVLMs can call external tools to extract useful information to facilitate its own video detection task; (2) Structuring the prompt can affect LVLM's reasoning ability to interpret information in video content. Our proposed pipeline automatically selects a set of explicit knowledge tools for detection, and then adaptively adjusts the structure prompt by self-rewriting. Different from prior SOTA that trains additional detectors, our method is fully training-free and only requires inference of the LVLM for detection. To facilitate our research, we also create a new benchmark \vidfor with high-quality videos generated from multiple sources of video generation tools. Evaluation results show that LAVID improves F1 scores by 6.2 to 30.2% over the top baselines on our datasets across four SOTA LVLMs.**|
|**2025-02-20**|**Pitch Imperfect: Detecting Audio Deepfakes Through Acoustic Prosodic Analysis**|Kevin Warren et.al.|[2502.14726](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14726)|null|**Audio deepfakes are increasingly in-differentiable from organic speech, often fooling both authentication systems and human listeners. While many techniques use low-level audio features or optimization black-box model training, focusing on the features that humans use to recognize speech will likely be a more long-term robust approach to detection. We explore the use of prosody, or the high-level linguistic features of human speech (e.g., pitch, intonation, jitter) as a more foundational means of detecting audio deepfakes. We develop a detector based on six classical prosodic features and demonstrate that our model performs as well as other baseline models used by the community to detect audio deepfakes with an accuracy of 93% and an EER of 24.7%. More importantly, we demonstrate the benefits of using a linguistic features-based approach over existing models by applying an adaptive adversary using an $L_{\infty}$ norm attack against the detectors and using attention mechanisms in our training for explainability. We show that we can explain the prosodic features that have highest impact on the model's decision (Jitter, Shimmer and Mean Fundamental Frequency) and that other models are extremely susceptible to simple $L_{\infty}$ norm attacks (99.3% relative degradation in accuracy). While overall performance may be similar, we illustrate the robustness and explainability benefits to a prosody feature approach to audio deepfake detection.**|
|**2025-02-17**|**Lightweight Deepfake Detection Based on Multi-Feature Fusion**|Siddiqui Muhammad Yasir et.al.|[2502.11763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11763)|null|**Deepfake technology utilizes deep learning based face manipulation techniques to seamlessly replace faces in videos creating highly realistic but artificially generated content. Although this technology has beneficial applications in media and entertainment misuse of its capabilities may lead to serious risks including identity theft cyberbullying and false information. The integration of DL with visual cognition has resulted in important technological improvements particularly in addressing privacy risks caused by artificially generated deepfake images on digital media platforms. In this study we propose an efficient and lightweight method for detecting deepfake images and videos making it suitable for devices with limited computational resources. In order to reduce the computational burden usually associated with DL models our method integrates machine learning classifiers in combination with keyframing approaches and texture analysis. Moreover the features extracted with a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) local binary pattern (LBP) and KAZE bands were integrated to evaluate using random forest extreme gradient boosting extra trees and support vector classifier algorithms. Our findings show a feature-level fusion of HOG LBP and KAZE features improves accuracy to 92% and 96% on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DFv2 respectively.**|
|**2025-02-16**|**From Deception to Perception: The Surprising Benefits of Deepfakes for Detecting, Measuring, and Mitigating Bias**|Yizhi Liu et.al.|[2502.11195](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11195)|null|**While deepfake technologies have predominantly been criticized for potential misuse, our study demonstrates their significant potential as tools for detecting, measuring, and mitigating biases in key societal domains. By employing deepfake technology to generate controlled facial images, we extend the scope of traditional correspondence studies beyond mere textual manipulations. This enhancement is crucial in scenarios such as pain assessments, where subjective biases triggered by sensitive features in facial images can profoundly affect outcomes. Our results reveal that deepfakes not only maintain the effectiveness of correspondence studies but also introduce groundbreaking advancements in bias measurement and correction techniques. This study emphasizes the constructive role of deepfake technologies as essential tools for advancing societal equity and fairness.**|
|**2025-02-15**|**Do Deepfake Detectors Work in Reality?**|Simiao Ren et.al.|[2502.10920](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10920)|null|**Deepfakes, particularly those involving faceswap-based manipulations, have sparked significant societal concern due to their increasing realism and potential for misuse. Despite rapid advancements in generative models, detection methods have not kept pace, creating a critical gap in defense strategies. This disparity is further amplified by the disconnect between academic research and real-world applications, which often prioritize different objectives and evaluation criteria. In this study, we take a pivotal step toward bridging this gap by presenting a novel observation: the post-processing step of super-resolution, commonly employed in real-world scenarios, substantially undermines the effectiveness of existing deepfake detection methods. To substantiate this claim, we introduce and publish the first real-world faceswap dataset, collected from popular online faceswap platforms. We then qualitatively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on real-world deepfakes, revealing that their accuracy approaches the level of random guessing. Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the significant performance degradation caused by common post-processing techniques. By addressing this overlooked challenge, our study underscores a critical avenue for enhancing the robustness and practical applicability of deepfake detection methods in real-world settings.**|

|**2025-02-27**|**Judge a Book by its Cover: Investigating Multi-Modal LLMs for Multi-Page Handwritten Document Transcription**|Benjamin Gutteridge et.al.|[2502.20295](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20295)|null|**Handwritten text recognition (HTR) remains a challenging task, particularly for multi-page documents where pages share common formatting and contextual features. While modern optical character recognition (OCR) engines are proficient with printed text, their performance on handwriting is limited, often requiring costly labeled data for fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing multi-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various configurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both as end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image components. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM transcription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with just the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features without incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a multi-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first page' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even enhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR error patterns from a single page.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration**|Xuzheng Yang et.al.|[2502.20104](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104)|null|**Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. To advance this field, we introduce a new REC dataset with two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject non-existent targets, an often-overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. To address fine-grained compositional REC, we propose novel methods based on a Specialist-MLLM collaboration framework, leveraging the complementary strengths of them: Specialist Models handle simpler tasks efficiently, while MLLMs are better suited for complex reasoning. Based on this synergy, we introduce two collaborative strategies. The first, Slow-Fast Adaptation (SFA), employs a routing mechanism to adaptively delegate simple tasks to Specialist Models and complex tasks to MLLMs. Additionally, common error patterns in both models are mitigated through a target-refocus strategy. The second, Candidate Region Selection (CRS), generates multiple bounding box candidates based on Specialist Model and uses the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to identify the correct target. Extensive experiments on our dataset and other challenging compositional benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The SFA strategy achieves a trade-off between localization accuracy and efficiency, and the CRS strategy greatly boosts the performance of both Specialist Models and MLLMs. We aim for this work to offer valuable insights into solving complex real-world tasks by strategically combining existing tools for maximum effectiveness, rather than reinventing them.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**AsymLoRA: Harmonizing Data Conflicts and Commonalities in MLLMs**|Xuyang Wei et.al.|[2502.20035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20035)|**[link](https://github.com/clin0212/hydralora)**|**Effective instruction fine-tuning on diverse image-text datasets is crucial for developing a versatile Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), where dataset composition dictates the model's adaptability across multimodal tasks. However, complex datasets often contain inherent conflicts -- stemming from modality-specific optimization objectives -- and latent commonalities that enable cross-task transfer, which most existing approaches handle separately. To bridge this gap, we introduce AsymLoRA, a parameter-efficient tuning framework that unifies knowledge modularization and cross-modal coordination via asymmetric LoRA: task-specific low-rank projections (matrix B) that preserve distinct adaptation pathways for conflicting objectives, and a shared projection (matrix A) that consolidates cross-modal commonalities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AsymLoRA consistently surpasses both vanilla LoRA, which captures only commonalities, and LoRA-MoE, which focuses solely on conflicts, achieving superior model performance and system efficiency across diverse benchmarks.\href{Code}{https://github.com/Clin0212/HydraLoRA/blob/main/MLLM-HydraLoRA/README.md}.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**Joint Fusion and Encoding: Advancing Multimodal Retrieval from the Ground Up**|Lang Huang et.al.|[2502.20008](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20008)|null|**Information retrieval is indispensable for today's Internet applications, yet traditional semantic matching techniques often fall short in capturing the fine-grained cross-modal interactions required for complex queries. Although late-fusion two-tower architectures attempt to bridge this gap by independently encoding visual and textual data before merging them at a high level, they frequently overlook the subtle interplay essential for comprehensive understanding. In this work, we rigorously assess these limitations and introduce a unified retrieval framework that fuses visual and textual cues from the ground up, enabling early cross-modal interactions for enhancing context interpretation. Through a two-stage training process--comprising post-training adaptation followed by instruction tuning--we adapt MLLMs as retrievers using a simple one-tower architecture. Our approach outperforms conventional methods across diverse retrieval scenarios, particularly when processing complex multi-modal inputs. Notably, the joint fusion encoder yields greater improvements on tasks that require modality fusion compared to those that do not, underscoring the transformative potential of early integration strategies and pointing toward a promising direction for contextually aware and effective information retrieval.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**Picking the Cream of the Crop: Visual-Centric Data Selection with Collaborative Agents**|Zhenyu Liu et.al.|[2502.19917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19917)|null|**To improve Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) ability to process images and complex instructions, researchers predominantly curate large-scale visual instruction tuning datasets, which are either sourced from existing vision tasks or synthetically generated using LLMs and image descriptions. However, they often suffer from critical flaws, including misaligned instruction-image pairs and low-quality images. Such issues hinder training efficiency and limit performance improvements, as models waste resources on noisy or irrelevant data with minimal benefit to overall capability. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{Vi}sual-Centric \textbf{S}election approach via \textbf{A}gents Collaboration (ViSA), which centers on image quality assessment and image-instruction relevance evaluation. Specifically, our approach consists of 1) an image information quantification method via visual agents collaboration to select images with rich visual information, and 2) a visual-centric instruction quality assessment method to select high-quality instruction data related to high-quality images. Finally, we reorganize 80K instruction data from large open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSA outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art models on seven benchmarks, using only 2.5\% of the original data, highlighting the efficiency of our data selection approach. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ViSA.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**Optimus-2: Multimodal Minecraft Agent with Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy**|Zaijing Li et.al.|[2502.19902](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19902)|null|**Building an agent that can mimic human behavior patterns to accomplish various open-world tasks is a long-term goal. To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.**|

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.**|
|**2025-02-27**|**Improving Adversarial Transferability in MLLMs via Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment Attack**|Chenhe Gu et.al.|[2502.19672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19672)|null|**Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have recently gained attention for their capabilities in image recognition and understanding. However, while MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the transferability of these attacks across different models remains limited, especially under targeted attack setting. Existing methods primarily focus on vision-specific perturbations but struggle with the complex nature of vision-language modality alignment. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment (DynVLA) Attack, a novel approach that injects dynamic perturbations into the vision-language connector to enhance generalization across diverse vision-language alignment of different models. Our experimental results show that DynVLA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across various MLLMs, including BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT4, LLaVA, and closed-source models such as Gemini.**|
|**2025-02-26**|**ImageChain: Advancing Sequential Image-to-Text Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models**|Danae Sánchez Villegas et.al.|[2502.19409](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19409)|null|**Reasoning over sequences of images remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces ImageChain, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In ImageChain, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the next-scene description task -- achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, ImageChain achieves robust zero-shot out-of-domain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning.**|
|**2025-02-26**|**M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance**|Qingpei Guo et.al.|[2502.18778](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778)|null|**We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.**|
